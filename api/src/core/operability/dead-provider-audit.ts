/**
 * Dead-provider HTTP attempt audit (R5 — 2026-05-09).
 *
 * Phase 1 shipped `recordDeadProviderHttpAttempt` as a counter that
 * callers MUST manually increment when they detect a bypass of the
 * near-zero skip path. That requires every adapter / fallback / retry
 * code path to know about the audit — fragile and easy to forget.
 *
 * R5 adds a **passive auditor** that watches HTTP outcomes against the
 * registry state and detects bypasses automatically. Three design
 * choices are open:
 *
 *   A) **Adapter-level wrap**: instrument fetch inside each provider
 *      adapter. Most precise (we know exactly which fetch was made and
 *      which provider it belongs to), but requires touching N adapter
 *      files and breaks adapter encapsulation.
 *
 *   B) **base-strategy.ts post-hoc check**: after every executeModel
 *      attempt, compare (providerId, modelId) against the registry's
 *      pre-attempt state. If state was fatal AND skip would have
 *      returned true, count as bypass. Single instrumentation point,
 *      but only catches bypasses going through executeModel — misses
 *      adapter calls from other code paths (e.g., embedding pipeline,
 *      readiness probe).
 *
 *   C) **Failure-time inference**: when a request FAILS with a class
 *      that should have skipped (auth_failed re-occurrence within
 *      cooldown), infer that we made a dead-provider HTTP call.
 *      Cheapest but produces false negatives for slow failures.
 *
 * This file ships the SCAFFOLDING — the entry point + the
 * `recordHttpOutcome` API. The DECISION on which strategy is
 * left to the project owner (see TODO below).

/**
 * Determines whether an HTTP attempt was a "dead provider" bypass —

 * `shouldSkipNearZero` and wasn't.
 *
 * Strategy: TIME-WINDOW (decision recorded 2026-05-09).
 *
 *   1. No prior record → not a bypass (first attempt populates state).
 *   2. State is neither fatal nor transient-skip → call was always
 *      legitimate. Not a bypass.
 *   3. State IS in a skip class AND `attemptedAt < nextProbeAfter` →
 *      the call should have been skipped. Bypass.
 *   4. State IS in a skip class AND `attemptedAt >= nextProbeAfter` →
 *      the cooldown elapsed; this was a legitimate reprobe. Not a
 *      bypass.
 *
 * Why TIME-WINDOW: the registry's `nextProbeAfter` is the same field
 * that `shouldSkipNearZero` reads, so we get exact symmetry — the
 * audit detects exactly what skip would have prevented, no more, no
 * less. False positives on legitimate post-cooldown reprobes are
 * eliminated by the timestamp comparison.
 *
 * O(1): single registry lookup + Date.parse. No async, no DB.
